# ForecastApp

This is an implementation sample of the Android Architecture Components. I started building this app from a free online course and will continue it from time to time to try new components and stuff.

The app uses:

	- MVVM pattern
	- Architecture Components (LiveData,  ViewModel and Room)
	- Dependency injection with Kodein
	- The Retrofit library to fetch the weather forecast from the Apixu Weather API
	- Kotlin coroutines
	- Navigation Architecture Component
